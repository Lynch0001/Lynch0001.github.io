## Hi, Welcome to my GitHub page!

Spring-Angular Developer

### About Me

I retired from the Army in June 2019 where I was a strategic plans and policy officer. I plan on transitioning to an entry level developer role after Labor Day 2020. Since leaving the Army, I have explored Python, Java and C++. I'm most comfortable with Java and Spring tied to Angular. I'm starting to explore spring micro services and D3 and GIS charting. I am curious about most things and like puzzles and quiz shows. Really interested in international relations, history (particularly military history), and science (astronomy mostly but also interested in physics and chemistry). Live in Reston with my wife, son and labradoodle.
