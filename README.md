# About Me

I retired from the Army in June 2019 where I was a strategic plans and policy officer. I'm working towards transitioning to an entry level developer role. Since leaving the Army, I have explored Python, Java and C++. I'm most comfortable with Java and Spring tied to Angular. On the frontend, I'm familiar with HTML, CSS and javascript.  I'm also familiar with Maven, but not Gradle.  I'm starting to explore Spring micro services and looking forward to getting into D3 and GIS charting. I am a lifelong learner and curious about most things. Really interested in international relations, history (particularly military history), and science (astronomy mostly but also interested in physics and chemistry). Live in Reston, Virginia with my wife, son and labradoodle.

# Projects
<p>Each project respresents an opportunity for me to explore some topic of interest; expand the depth and breadth of my understaning of some useful or interesting technologies; and demonstrate at least a basic level of understanding of software development fundamentals.</p>

## Project Task Manager

<p>Description: Basic web application that allows a user to manage projects/tasks built with Spring, Angular and MySQL. This was my first effort to integrate frontend, backend, and database components into a functioning application.  I wasn't concerned with security, logging or data validation at this point.

## Policy Discussion Board

<p>Description: This is a more complete single-page application that allows a user to review and comment on national security issues.  It is also built with Spring, Angular and MySQL and includes basic authentication security, logging or client-side data validation.

## ExoPlanet Data Explorer

<p>Description: [Still working on this] Web application that allows users to view data fed by a CSV file from the NASA Exoplanet Data Archive(Roughly 4000 planets that have been identified outside of our solar system). It is built with Spring, Angular and PostgreSQL.

## What's Next

<p>I'm planning on starting a project to build a simple bookstore app that will allow users to see availible books and reviews and to select/place books in a cart for simulated purchase.  The project is a vehicle to learn about micro services and will include a customer service, a book service, a review service, a store service and an order service.  This will focus on the backend components and NoSQL database technologies.</p>
