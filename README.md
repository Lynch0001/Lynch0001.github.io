# About Me

I retired from the Army in June 2019 where I was a strategic plans and policy officer. I plan on transitioning to an entry level developer role after Labor Day 2020. Since leaving the Army, I have explored Python, Java and C++. I'm most comfortable with Java and Spring tied to Angular. On the frontend, I'm familiar with HTML, CSS and javascript.  I'm also familiar with Maven, but not Gradle.  I'm starting to explore Spring micro services and looking forward to getting into D3 and GIS charting. I am a lifelong learner and curious about most things. Really interested in international relations, history (particularly military history), and science (astronomy mostly but also interested in physics and chemistry). Live in Reston, Virginia with my wife, son and labradoodle.

# Projects

## Project Task Manager

<p>Description: Basic web application that allows a user to manage projects/tasks built with Spring, Angular and MySQL. This was my first effort to integrate frontend, backend, and database components into a functioning application.  I wasn't concerned with security, logging or data validation at this point.

## Policy Discussion Board

<p>Description: This is a more complete single-page application that allows a user to review and comment on national security issues.  It is also built with Spring, Angular and MySQL and includes basic authentication security, logging or client-side data validation.
